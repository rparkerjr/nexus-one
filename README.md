nifty bells and whistles, various and sundry WIPs, things I use(d)

#### Update 6.24.20
Added diceroller.py. Created the script just to see if I could make a flexible dice roller. It allows you to specify number of dice, how many sides, and value to add to individual rolls and/or to the total.

#### Update 6.18.19
Added two scripts which I use to enable/disable the touchpad on my laptop as there are no hardware or software ways to do so. I created desktop shortcuts which execute the code now.

- tpoff.sh : disables laptop touchpad
- tpon.sh : enables laptop touchpad
